## Next
- Show link to docs when there are validation errors
- Improve some of the validation messages
- Show validation error when `server.pem` is a path to a public key
- Removed unnecessary stack traces when the app's path is incorrect or `meteor build` failed

## 1.2.11 - June 14, 2017
- Deployment verifier shows last 100 lines of the app's log when it fails (it previously was 50 lines)
- Fix `mup setup` restarting docker

## 1.2.10 - June 4, 2017
- Deployment verifier no longer requires the http status code to be 200.

## 1.2.9 - June 3, 2017
- Add shared nginx proxy
    - Is configured with a `proxy` object instead of using `meteor.ssl` and `meteor.nginx`
    - If multiple apps are deployed to a server, routes requests to the correct container
    - Adds `mup proxy` command. For a list of subcommands, run `mup proxy help`
    - Supports using custom certificates. This should be used instead of `meteor.ssl` since the previous image used for custom certificates had a security vulnerability.
    - Also can set up Let's Encrypt
    - Supports configuring the env variables for the nginx and let's encrypt containers.

Big thanks to @shaiamir for his work on the shared proxy.

- `mup stop` also stops nginx proxy and let's encrypt containers
- App inside container's port is set to `docker.imagePort`. The app is still accessible on `env.PORT`.
- Will build app if cached build is not found and `--cached-build` flag is set
- Fix some bugs with verifying deployment
- Add support for `zodern:mup-helpers` package. Since version 1.2.7, verifying deployment fails if the app's `/` route's http code is other than 200, or if it does not redirect on the server to a page that does have that http code. Adding `zodern:mup-helpers` allows meteor up to sucessfully validate the deployment.
